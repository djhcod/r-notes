# 单细胞数据整合（integration）

Integration of single-cell sequencing datasets, for example across experimental batches, donors, or conditions, is often an important step in scRNA-seq workflows. Integrative analysis can help to match shared cell types and states across datasets, which can boost statistical power, and most importantly, facilitate accurate comparative analysis across datasets. In previous versions of Seurat we introduced methods for integrative analysis, including our 'anchor-based' integration workflow. Many labs have also published powerful and pioneering methods, including [Harmony](https://portals.broadinstitute.org/harmony/) and [scVI](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/index.html), for integrative analysis. Please see our [Integrating scRNA-seq data with multiple tools](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/seurat5_integration) vignette.
